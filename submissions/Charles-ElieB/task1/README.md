I run blockchain nodes at a Professional for excellent quality. His name is EasyNode (app.easy-nodes.xyz)
	- Story Testnet Full node
	- Linea
	- 0g
	- Babylon
	- Zora
	- Juneo
	- Rivalz

As I am passionate about blockchain, I also run nodes myself on personal VPS:
	- Linea
	- Babylon
	- Farcaster


Managing nodes personally has given me a lot of experience, but for some nodes I prefer it to be done by professionals so that you have the best quality, that's why I chose EasyNode for my Story node.

I am also active on Discord and X. I really like the dynamism of the community on Discord :) I participate in games, meme contests and discuss the project with my Discord mates.

I'm also passionate about sharing knowledge with the wider Community :)
